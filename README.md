# Recipe_rating_Intel
## Overview:
This project aims to predict food ratings using machine learning models trained on various features extracted from recipes. By leveraging data such as ingredients, cooking methods, and user reviews, our models can provide accurate predictions of the ratings a recipe is likely to receive.
## Machine Learning Models:
Various machine learning algorithms are employed, such as

•Logistic Regression with 75% accuracy 

•Decision Tree with 63% accuracy 

•SVM with 75% accuracy 

•XgBoost with 76% accuracy 

These models are trained on the dataset to learn patterns and relationships between recipe features and ratings, enabling them to make predictions on unseen data effectively.
